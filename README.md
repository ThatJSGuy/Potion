![alt text](https://github.com/ThatJSGuy/Potion/assets/potions3.png?raw=true)



I created this pseudo-code language to aid myself in learning Vue.js and all of its intricacies. It was made with readability in mind, so it is made as close to the english language as possible. I hope this helps even 1 person in their quest for learning and betterment. That will have made my time and efforts worth it..
