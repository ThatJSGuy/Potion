# Potion Psuedo-Lang

![alt text](https://github.com/ThatJSGuy/Potion/blob/main/assets/potions3.png?raw=true)



I created this pseudo-code language to aid myself in learning Javascript and all of its intricacies. I found myself getting frustrated trying to decide which framework to use, which supplementary languages to learn, etc. I see no reason why we cant have a language that compiles to JS, Rust, and every other language or framework therein.  This language was made with readability in mind, so it is made as close to the english language as possible, without sacrificing functionality. I hope this helps even 1 person in their quest for learning and betterment. That will have made my time and efforts worth it..
