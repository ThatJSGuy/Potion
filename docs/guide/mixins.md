# Mixins and Plugins

Mixins and plugins are powerful mechanisms in Vue.js that allow you to reuse code, extend functionality, and enhance the capabilities of your components.

## Mixins

Mixins in Vue.js are reusable code snippets that can be mixed into multiple components. They provide a way to encapsulate and share common logic, options, and lifecycle hooks.

```potion
mixin LogMixin
  created
    console.log('Mixin hook called')

MyComponent is
  mixins are
    LogMixin
```

In the example above, we define a mixin called `LogMixin` that logs a message when the component is created. The `LogMixin` is then mixed into the `MyComponent` component using the `mixins` keyword.

## Plugins

Plugins in Vue.js are reusable pieces of functionality that can be globally added to your Vue application. They typically provide additional methods, directives, or components that can be accessed throughout your application.

```potion
plugin MyPlugin
  install(Vue)
    Vue.prototype.$myMethod = () => {
      // Custom logic
    }

Vue.use(MyPlugin)
```

In the example above, we define a plugin called `MyPlugin` that adds a custom method `$myMethod` to the `Vue.prototype`. The plugin is then installed globally using `Vue.use()`.

## Conclusion

Mixins and plugins are valuable tools in Vue.js for code reuse and extensibility. Mixins allow you to share common logic between components, while plugins enable you to add global functionality to your application.

By leveraging mixins and plugins effectively, you can enhance the reusability and maintainability of your Vue.js codebase.
