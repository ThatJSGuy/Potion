# Introduction to Potion

Welcome to Potion, a pseudo-code language for Vue.js that I created to aid my own learning process, introduce my son to the world of programming, and hopefully, help at least one other person. If this language can make someone's journey into programming a little bit easier, then all the effort put into this project will have been worth it.

## Why Potion?

When I first started learning programming, I found that the syntax of many languages can be quite intimidating for beginners. It's like learning a new language, with its own grammar, vocabulary, and idioms. This can be a big hurdle for people who are just starting out, especially for children.

That's why I created Potion. I wanted a language that was easy to read and as close to English as possible. With Potion, you can write Vue.js code that looks like this:

```potion
MyComponent is
  data are
    message: 'Hello, world!'
```

It's simple, it's readable, and it's intuitive. You don't need to know what a function or an object is to understand what this code does. You just need to know English.

## Who is Potion for?

Potion is for anyone who wants to learn programming, but finds the syntax of traditional programming languages intimidating. It's for parents who want to introduce their children to the world of programming. It's for teachers who want to teach programming in a more intuitive and engaging way. And it's for experienced programmers who want a simpler, more readable syntax for their Vue.js code.

If you're interested in learning programming, if you're passionate about education, or if you just want to try something new, I invite you to join me on this journey. Let's make programming more accessible, one Potion at a time.
