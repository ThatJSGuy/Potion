# Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique that allows you to pre-render your Vue.js application on the server before sending it to the client. This can improve initial load times, SEO friendliness, and provide a better user experience.

## Enabling SSR

To enable SSR in your Potion application, you can use the `serverRendered` keyword within your component definition.

```potion
MyComponent is
  serverRendered: true
```

In the example above, we set the `serverRendered` option to `true` for the `MyComponent`. This instructs the server to render this component on the server-side before sending it to the client.

## Server-Side Rendering with Vue Server Renderer

Under the hood, Vue SSR utilizes the Vue Server Renderer to render Vue components on the server. The Vue Server Renderer allows you to render Vue components into HTML strings that can be directly injected into the initial server response.

To use the Vue Server Renderer, you need to configure a server environment and set up a server script to handle the rendering process.

## Benefits of SSR

Server-Side Rendering offers several benefits, including:

- Improved initial load times: Pre-rendering the application on the server reduces the time required to render components on the client, resulting in faster initial page loads.
- SEO friendliness: Search engines can easily crawl and index the pre-rendered HTML, improving the visibility and SEO performance of your application.
- Better user experience: Users can see the content of the application more quickly, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Limitations and Considerations

While SSR provides many advantages, it also introduces some limitations and considerations. SSR can be more complex to set up and maintain compared to client-side rendering. It requires server infrastructure and may have limitations on certain Vue features and APIs.

It's essential to carefully consider your application's requirements and performance goals when deciding whether to implement SSR.

## Conclusion

Server-Side Rendering is a powerful technique that can enhance the performance and SEO of your Vue.js applications. By enabling SSR and utilizing the Vue Server Renderer, you can achieve faster initial loads and provide a better user experience.
