# Vuex

Vuex is a state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications. It provides a centralized store that allows you to manage the state of your application in a predictable and organized manner.

## Store

The Vuex store serves as a single source of truth for your application's state. It is defined using the `store` keyword within a component block.

```potion
store is
  state are
    count: 0

  mutations are
    increment(state)
      state.count += 1
```

In the example above, we define a Vuex store with a single state property called `count`. The `mutations` section contains a `increment` mutation that modifies the `count` state.

## Mutations

Mutations are responsible for modifying the state in a Vuex store. They are defined within the `mutations` section of the store and should be synchronous.

```potion
mutations are
  increment(state)
    state.count += 1
```

In the example above, the `increment` mutation simply increments the value of the `count` state property by one.

## Actions

Actions are used to perform asynchronous operations or complex logic in Vuex. They are defined within the `actions` section of the store and can commit mutations.

```potion
actions are
  increment(context)
    context.commit('increment')
```

In the example above, the `increment` action commits the `increment` mutation using the `context.commit()` method.

## Getters

Getters in Vuex allow you to compute derived state based on the store's state. They are defined within the `getters` section of the store.

```potion
getters are
  doubleCount(state)
    return state.count * 2
```

In the example above, we define a getter called `doubleCount` that returns the double of the `count` state property.

## Conclusion

Vuex provides a robust and structured approach to managing the state of your Vue.js applications. By utilizing a centralized store, mutations, actions, and getters, you can effectively handle complex state management scenarios and ensure consistency throughout your application.
